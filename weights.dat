# This weight file is generated by BP (Erhan Oztop -Dec'99)
# This file specfies the network size and the weight values
# That the network sizes excludes the clamped 1's for input and hidden layer
# So the weight matrices has one more column for the clamped unit.

# Note: To train the network you need to load a pattern file
# Note: You can not specify learning parameters from this file
# Note: If you want to continue a learning session that you saved the 
# weights from, use Make Network from Weight followed by Load Pattern then continue training.

# First matrix is the input(x)->hidden(y) weights(inputToHiddenW) 
# Second matrix is the hidden(y)->output(z) weights(hiddenToOuputW) 
# The network computes  sgn(hiddenToOuputW.sgn(inputToHiddenW.x)) where sgn(t)=1/(1+exp(-t))
